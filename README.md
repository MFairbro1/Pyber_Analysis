# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview

### The purpose of this analysis is to organize ride-sharing data by the city/location type, and create a visualization to show the total weekly fares for each city type. The goal is to achieve some understanding of how the data differs by the city type and to report the findings. 

## Results

### From the summary data frame we can see that there is a large disparity between the number of drivers in urban areas compared to those in suburban and rural areas. Rural and suburban areas have far less drivers and there are less rides. Average fares are higher in rural and suburban areas and overall these locations generate less in total fares. This is well depicted on the graph:

## Summary

### The disparities can probably be explained by the fact that demand for ride-sharing is simply smaller in suburban and rural areas. People in these locations are probably more likely to rely on personal transportation for convenience. These areas are also less densely populated than urban locations and distances between points of interest are larger. This could also make ride-sharing less practical.

### In order to remedy some of the disparity, perhaps PyBer could try to increase their number of drivers in rural and suburban locations. They could also try to incentivize customers with special promotions, or they could offer discounts.
